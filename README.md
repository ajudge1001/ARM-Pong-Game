Created during the [CSU11022](https://teaching.scss.tcd.ie/module/csu11022-introduction-to-computing-ii/) course with 2 other teammates. 

Developed in ARM Assembly using Visual Studio Code and an ARM micro controller. 

# How It Works
 Pressing the blue button will start the game and act as your input. 
 
 We simulated a ball being sent back and fourth by manipulating the output bits to the small led's on top of the microcontroller. 

 As the player rallies the ball, the game speeds up and increases the speed of the ball and lowers the buffer alloted to the player to hit the ball on time.
